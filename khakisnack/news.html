<td> Who the hell would be reading this?!?! Well, we're done folks.
It's been an insane ride, but alas, the Great Rock'n'Roll Swindle Part
2 seems to have finally come to an end. First, the really long boring
part. We played our last show and it was crazy. Not because we were
sounding good or anything, just because it felt freaking amazing.
Chris, essentially TKS's founder, made his triumphant non-costume
wearing return to the stage to play bass for "My Very Own Flag". After
the heartfelt performance "Mr.T" hung out on stage while we pretty much
did all the Snack classics(ie almost everything we had ever done), from
the loved and hated "...Blender..." to the always screwed up
"P.S..."....covers of "Like a Prayer/420 club", a new one time only
song called "The Marco Song", the hip hop masterpiece known as "Dolla
Dolla Bill Ya'll", some other carp i can't remember because it was in
june and of course, the infamous TKS Anthem "Barnone...Worst Christmas
Ever". We closed by playing some of "Happy Bunny/Pie Are Squared"(early
snack metal...death metal) then closed with the signature "Robbie
Alomar Jr/Wyclef Jean" We said bye, sold a whack of cd's, spent every
cent we made that night and it was done...kinda. I still have a pile of
CD's if anyone wants one...it's cheap and contains sontent from Saved
By The Bell...khakisnack@hotmail.com. Also, Dave and i are still kinda
writing crap. Actually, one of my favourite songs we've ever done is
called "I'd Sell My Liver For Just A Piece Of Your Heart"...we had the
idea for a long time, but this summer one ngiht, we changed around the
guitar part, wrote all the words, and now it's a half decent song. What
does that mean? I don't know. But i have class and can't finish this
now, so peace, i'll try to get pics up soon...it's only been over a
year...later</td>

<td>Werd up Gina! Well sure, the snack has been livin' la vida loca
recently, but we is ready for the homestretch. It's almost over, but
not just yet. We just finished recording songs at that "Parkhill" place
with the infamous Scott "Why don't you guys practice before trying to
record" Kohmer. Ah. Good times. Well not so much for him, but you get
the idea. Anyway, things turned out ok, and i'm pretty pleased with 2
or 3 of them. I STILL hate blender and will forever refer to it as
Blender Of SUCK. The "Barnone..." mp3 will be up on mp3.com any day
now. What else...ah, the show on the 26th will indeed be the last snack
show ever, so please show up and be prepared to see hijinx. Other than
that, mike has a wad of pictures i gave him, so i pressume as school
winds down those'll pop up. Anyway, go sign the new guestbook and tell
us how much you love Chris and stuff. Until next time, keep on rockin'
in a free world.</td>

<td>Ok, things are starting to be cleaned up on this site...finally. I
started cleaning up the lyrics section, and over the next while we'll
probably pick up another guestbook, get those photogs up, and who knows
what else. Also, Messy and i started to do up some more songs over the
course of the weekend. Of the two we came up with, all i can say is
that one has the working title "I'd Sell My Liver for Just a Piece of
Your Heart." Anyhow i am going to go listen to the new Daft Punk CD.
It's called Discovery and it's great. Go buy it. Now. Bye.</td>

<tr><td>April 9, 2001</td>
<td> Ok....ok ok. So i am too lazy to update this site and such.
Anyhow, stuffs been going on lately. One such thing was that we played
a show of sorts in Collingwood. Ah yes, the C-Wood. Well it was
interesting because thursday night, everyone's at home watching
Survivor. I call dave, content over the removal of Jerri, and he tells
me that he got a call asking us to play...the next day...in
Collingwood. We hadn't practiced since our last show, but figured, why
not. So, the next afternoon TKS hit the road. After a healthy diet of
slurpees, subs, and Perrier, the snackeroo hit up the elegant, yet
simple Lions Club. I put the Santo outfit on.... but thanks to a long
delay waiting for a bass amp that didn't make it in time he grew
tiresome, and the show was played without get-up. It was...interesting.
We were maybe a little dull, but there was still the odd
momment...maybe...either way, it was a pleasant road trip and put some
life back into the Snack. Thanks to whoever for everything. Meanwhile,
back in my den/nook/workery/study, i've got a whole slew/whack of
photos. Hopefully i'll give them to mike who will want to scan them up
nice and good....pics include recording shots, tons of scorned poets,
and even collingwood...a walmart ad may also find its way on. We might
be playing an upcoming show...at the school or something? I dont know,
it's pretty sketchy/vague. Either way, snack lives on. "Payce", as it
were.</td>

<td>February 18, 2001</td>
<td>Hi. Well, we played the show on Friday, and i must say it was
aaaaaaaaaaalright. It was a pretty wacky evening. We show up thinking
were are gonna play at 9 or so. After sitting on our duffs for a while
they tell us we have 7:30. No one we know would have made it. So, after
much yammering and discussion we traded timeslots with a Croatian guy
that had long hair. Now we're on at 10:50. Which causes a lot more
confusion. Anyway, we went to Subway, obviously avoiding the "Sub Nazi"
that works at the Mr. Sub there, and had delicious sandwiches. I wish i
was eating one right now. Then we went to some other place...the black
bull or something...and talked about worldly matters while dave watched
foxy boxing. But i digress...the show ended up being pretty fun. We
were grunge, goth, hick and vexus all at once...and that's just what it
looked like. Not to mention a memorable appearance by a large mascot
sized bear, some breakdancing...and then seeing Chris the Bear get
stolen. We played two new songs. They were a little shaky....so i
forgot a few lyrics....but they were still pretty fun to do. Opened
with an unrecognizable cover of Forgot About Dre and did all the snack
usuals including a souped up version of Dolla Dolla Bill Ya'll
(Paul=Good) We even played an encore much to the displeasure of our
friends at Supernova. I enjoyed being kindly escorted off the stage
after greatly exceeding our alotted time. At this time i want to say a
very very big thank you to everyone who came out to the show. I mean,
the only reason it was any good was because of the high number of
friends...and AT A SUPERNOVA SHOW. We understand ten bucks is a lot,
and when people who don't like this kind of music show up, and people
from Owen Sound(!) show up, it's beyond hype. We have already received
pictures and we have both audio and video tape of the show. Pictures
will be up soon and we are going to post some mp3's despite their lack
of quality just for kicks. It was fun. The next one will be better.</td>

will be a rather hype affair. The new set is pretty cool. Expect the
unexpected. Talk with us if you need tickeroos. Hope to see you rocking
out as the scorned poets burn the kathedral down in pure snacky pack
style. werd.</td>

<td> Things are moving along nicely. i(d-wreck) got together with
messler again, and we finally actually put together the little we had
for PS Thanks for the Jolt Colas, and songified it with lyrics and
stuff. If any of our songs don't suck, then i think this may be the
one. Also, we scanned up a whole whack of pics. 4 are up for the time
being, more will be up after exams. Calculus, Algebra and Chemistry can
honk on bobo for all i care. Reminder: SCORNED POETS-FEBRUARY
16th-KATHEDRAL! NEW SONGS, NEW MEMBERS, NEW GET-UPS! Payce g's.</td>

<td> Right, so ain't nuthin be broken up yet. There have been a few
changes as far as instruments and members go, but i'm not writing
anything now because it's still early and i really don't feel like
changing the band list around yet. But yes, things are looking less
than shabby. Also, we're all in exams. So what? Well...actually, good
point, who cares. At least messler and i were able to justify not
studying by coming up with another snackified original. It's the sequel
to the now legendary Chris Got A Blender...And that is all i'm saying
about that. I don't have a scanner, but i'm gonna ask our resident
computer geek Mike to scan us up some pictures in the next little
while. So hopefully we'll have some old lame pictures up soon.
Well...anyway....time for my daily dose of Otrivin. keep on keepin on</td>

<tr><td>October 28, 2000</td>
<td>Today, some much needed good news occured. The band put aside
personal differences in order to slowly attempt to put an end to its
downward spiral. First, Mike "the Doogies" Diggs decided to drop his
restraining order against the band. In response, Ian decided to drop
his class action lawsuit against Mike, for alledgedly tampering with
"his" trumpet, two years ago before a show(true story). Chris and Derek
also finally announced that they have officially bowed out of the race
to 200 pounds. This news is relevant, as they will be spending less
time devoted to gluttonnery, and more time trying to not be the worst
members of the band(which quite frankly they both are.) Dave, though
skilled and not in need of practice, declined a multi-million dollar
deal to write recipes for Canadian Living Magazine in order to devote
more time to the Snack 2000-2001 Project. And finally, we have hired an
intellectual tycoon to come in and do an analysis of the corporation.
After the analysis is made, major restructuring will occur. At this
time the Snack would like to thank all its loyal supporters and fan
for, in the words of one: "keepin' it real snacky pack, yo." Letters of
support can be written to the band directly at khakisnack@hotmail.com,
or to their record label at porknjeans@hotmail.com. A bientot...</td>

<td>K, tons of crud going on. First of all Dr. Dre quit the band,
leaving behind many problems. These include the fact that we planned on
recording during the first weekend of June. This has not changed, and
regardless of who is drumming, we still plan on recording. Also, we
planned on playing our school's fun lunch, as well as a show on the
16th. We have backed out of these officially. This situation sucks and
quite frankly i have no clue what is going on. In other news, the
videos have not been uploaded because when Chris made them on his
computer the files were ridiculously large. We are giving the tape to a
friend of our chief scientist Norm, who says he can get them done well.
Whatever... this is ridiculous.</td>

<td>DRE IN DA HOUSE! The audition was interesting. I thought i might
get beaten up because we called him in January or something, but
luckily i was left unharmed. The practise was held where it all began:
Chris's Moldy Basement. The guitar amp was busted, and Dave and Ian
both forgot their horns, but in the end the goal was accomplished...WE
HAVE A DRUMMER! He's really good and picks everything up quickly. We
did audition one other drummer, and although he was good and cool, he
needed a bit more time to get the hang of our music, and time is the
only thing we don't have right now. Anyway, it's time for grubbin, so
i's gotta go. KHAKI SNACK 4 LIFE.</td>

<td>Rumors have surfaced again that Dr. Dre (andre something) will be
auditioning for the band, in hopes of replacing Mike on the Drums.
Nothing has been confirmed they ARE just rumors. due to Mike's
departure, the practice space has moved from Mike's to Chris'. Plans to
begin recording have surfaced. You see, Dave has a neighbour with a
studio in his basement
and has invited us to record. Two songs are planned to be recorded:
Robbie Alomar Jr., and Chris' Blender. Things will
pickup around May. Who knows?. We need a drummer.

<td> Wow, so the show last night was kinda, sorta terrible, but nobody
in the band seems to care...we just have to start practising. The only
problem is that we no longer have a drummer because Mike quit after the
show last night. So, if you know anyone that plays the drums and stuff,
please let us know. Other than that, some more pictures are up, and
more are on the way. Thanks to all those who came to the show
(especially, the two newest memebers of the Snack Pack, Mike "Parrappa
The Rappa" Kopko,and MC Bones himself, Norman.....something) We're
sorry we dissapointed, but at least the band after us wailed/rocked.

<td>
It has been confirmed that the March 11th show at Shred Central Skate
Park will be the last one for Mike our drummer. He is leaving on good
terms and we will begin to ask around for a new drummer, seeing as our
last prospect felt we "sucked". Anyone interested should contact us.
Other than that, we have not made any form of set list, and therefore
we will be playing random songs, in random order. Yell something out,
and we may just play it......but we probably won't. See you at the
show.
Note: New pictures are up in the Media section. More from our first
show, Y2Khaki, and other memorable events are on the way...

<td>Khaki Snack hit the stage of the Reverb at around 7:40. Much to
their confusion, quite a crowd had gathered. Other than the fact that
Chris missed the soundcheck, we thought we were good to go. Ian and
Dave played Handel's Royal fireworks as entrance music for Chris and I.
The audience showed their appreciation with healthy cries of "YOU
SUCK". The next logical thing to do was play the chorus from the great
latin sensation Ricky Martin's Cup Of Life. After the traditional
massacre of a Less Than Jake classic, we moved on to perform Chris Got
a Blender for Christmas for the first time ever. This was followed by
the return of the notorious 80's hit "Luft Balloons", some more Less
Than Jake and then the band's favourite, "Robbie Alomar Is Your Father
Henceforth Making You Robbie Alomar Jr." From there, we played the
Snack Pack's fav, our rap song: "Dolla' Dolla' Bill Ya'll"(which
featured members of Laced, the 4:20 Club, Two Stroke Finish,
Punkdonalds, and Mugshot), then the last Less Than Jake cover, and
finished off with our tribute to mathematics, love, and hardcore
insanity "Pie Are Squared". Throw in a wig, a fitted doves and roses
shirt, some blue hair, and plenty of pelvic thrusts into the crowd and
you've got our show. Pictures and video footage will be posted as soon
as possible, by which i mean, whenever i feel like it.

now, so be patient. Here's the deal: we are playing a show on February
10th at the REVERB, with other bands like Two Stroke Finish, Mugshot,
Two-Face, and a whole bunch of other weirdos, like the window
toothpicks or something. We also will probably be playing a show at a
skate park of sorts on March 11th. I believe it's the first saturday of
the march break. Finally, most of the werds for Robbie Alomar Jr. are
now up on the music page. I am too lazy to index stuff now, so instead,
i just stuck them at the bottom. <b>PS: Khaki Snack Rocks! </b></td>

Yeah, so we're playing this show on the 10th. Yes, it is called
Skaghetti and Punkballs. Yes, we're aware that it is a queer name. No,
we are not exactly ready. Let's put it this way, we've practised maybe
twice since our last show, on December 3rd. We are scrapping about
three of our Less Than Jake covers, but don't worry, we've still got
two or three of them left. We're still trying to think of real lyrics
for Pie Are Squared, and we're finishing up on two other originals,
Robbie Alomar is your father..... and Chris Got A Blender For
Christmas. One interesting note is the fact that this will probably our
last show with Doogies on drums. He'll be off galavanting with Marco
and his band of goons. We're in the process of getting someone else,
but if you know anyone, tell us. Other than that, I'm trying to get the
Y2Khaki pictures up, but i don't have a scanner, so.....
