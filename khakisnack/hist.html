This would obviously be the section that will most likely go unread
but....It's content. I'll try not to leave out anyone.
</p><p>
Pre-Khaki Snack
</p><p>
At this point I was currently playing the drums, I had little skill and
even less regard for practice. Occasionaly Derek (guitar)and I would
practice, but would get little accomplished. Derek was far more
talented at his instrument than I was at mine. So instead of becoming a
die-hard drummer, I quit. </p><p>
During my break from whatever it was, I purchased a dismal bass guitar
from "U-Pawn-and-Smile"(Lakeshore Blvd. W around 30th street) for $180.
So now I owned a bass (minus amp) I practiced a little, learning
tabs,practicing with luke(you suck)and playing drums for Rory and his
band, etc.. But without a drummer Derek and I felt we were going
nowhere and we decided to practice less. So the band (derek and I)
needed a drummer. I went to the person known to have some connections.
Sarah. She made calls and calls, but nothing was to be found. Although
she did get me a pretty decent amp for $80 (we have a big budget)
During this time we experimented with my 82 year old grandfather as our
vocalist (Cliff, we love ya)........any questions?
</p><p>No drummer? sounds like time for another month-long break.
Anyway
we got back into it when Sarah intoduced us to Jackie our one-time
Tenor sax player. Our practice went like it always does, we get
frustrated after realizing we're terrible and give up. During that
practice Sarah made a stab at playing the trumpet, henceforth making
her in our band. We also listened to Jackie(2) play Alto sax but
quickly banished her from our property.
</p><p>
Khaki Snack -The Begining
</p><p>School had begun and we were still minus a:drummer,a name, horn
section,talent and vocals. So we decided to explore the schoolyard. Ian
came into play when we noticed that he played the french horn. Derek
and I quickly decided that if he knew how to play the french horn then
perhaps his skills could be converted to the trumpet (three keys,same
size mouthpiece, hey, it's not rocket science) So he stole a trumpet
from school (we deny having said that) and we were now with one horn
player. </p><p>
We practiced faithfully on the weekend but got little done. We all felt
we needed a drummer. So we scraped the bottom and picked up
Dave R. We gave him a try, and well...he was good but he was more
concerned with "changing the face of metal" than our band.Tentative
name "The Gizzmops" (thanks for coming Dave). So we couldn't break it
to this hulking beast that we wouldn't require his services, so we told
him we broke-up. We still want to change the face of metal with you
dave, give us a call. After that I promptly asked a seventh grader
(Tim) if he'd be interested, and the answer was a prompt "no." because
we, "sucked so bad." During this time we also considered Nick F for the
job but....why bother?
</p><p>So we hit another rock-bottom. We finally resorted to borrowing
a drummer from another band.Vexus, or Trouble with Charlie or whatever
anyways, Digs joined.(for now, don't get confortable) So now there were
four: Derek, Digs, Ian, and myself.
</p><p>
Khaki Snack -The Name
</p><p>The name "Khaki Snack" originated from a overly large sheet of
band names Ian had made. The names were brilliantly meaningless, and
they were
the best we heard ("we should call ourselves the Jizzmops" -Dave R)
other names included: Leg butter, Sour-Cream placibo dream, El
nin-yo-yo-ma, Test Tube Baby Ruth, Corpulent Vigilantes, Pierre Paul
Savoie: The Ageless Man, The KP Crew, and others. </p><p>
We needed to expand our horn section, and Harris seemed like the
answer. Too bad he thought we sucked . He recommended Dave T as a
drummer but we never asked. So Harris left our band after one practice
as well, to later join ......"Trouble with Charlie" or whatever.
So we hate him now.
</p><p>Around that time I got a call from a certain Christian...
He asked me to join his band. He already had a drummer, trumpet and
he'd be singing. I said allright and he got Derek in on this too, so we
we're all set to ditch Ian and Digs but........Christian never called
me back.
</p><p>
Digs booked us to play a venue in late-june and since it was early
may we procrastinated.......
</p><p>
Cue June 20, 1999 -few days before the show,
</p><p>
In haste we asked Andy to join our band to play his mean "bone"
He reluctantly accepted, after the promise of money.

Cue June 30 ,1999
</p><p>
The show went well. Too bad nobody saw us play because we
explicitly asked to open. We played 5 songs with no breaks
and promptly left the stage, just as our legions of fans
arrived.
</p><p>
The next day Andy quit. We hate you Andy.
</p><p>
November 15,1999
</p><p>
Marco (queerbait) quit his band Vexus (hacks) and therefore
we are entitled to Mike. Marco (bitchnugget), has expressed
an interest in singing for our band.(laugh) You suck Marco.
If you think I'm joking......Try me.

</p><p>
Dave joined and somehow and we had actual material.
Derek was 185lbs and  Chris was 182lbs (with no signs of slowing down) sound familiar?
</p><p>In the meantime, marco had reformed and reclaimed his rights on
doogies, leaving us in big trouble. Derek thought he was terrible and
so the band picked up Paul H. on a second guitar. We booked ourselves
into playing a Supernova show, but due to our extreme lack of practise
(due an extreme lack of our own drummer) we played as our fake heavy
metal alter-ego, Terminal Velocity. The show.....had it's momments, but
ultimately the band decided that two guitars were unecessary, so sadly
Paul H. was let go.
</p><p>We were already booked to play a show in February with Johnny
Toothpaste, Mugshot, Two Face, Two Stroke Finish, Laced, yadda yadda
yadda and we thought this would be inspiration. Sadly Derek was busy
coaching skiing, Chris was always playing and practising hockey, Dave
and Ian had the G.C. Bagel and Mike's time was consumed by his werk and
his preferred band. We practiced and less and less and less leaving us
worried. We managed to pull together a decent set, and things went
surprisingly well, but it was to be Dooger's last big show with the
Snack. We played one last, awful show at some drug cartel/skate park
with him, and that was it. </p><p> He had this to say : "You can take the drummer out of the
Snack, but you cant take the Snack out of the drummer. Its been a blast
guys. I had to hold back the tears during the last rendition of My Very
Own Flag (doogies style). It was by far the best we ever played it. I
hope you enjoyed the Iced Tea. Mike" </p><p> We hope to pull things together, and are booked to play this
June....as of April 16, we had a drummer again. The drummer is known
only as Dr. Dre. Oh, in more tragic news, Chris and Derek's weights
both plunged, and in Derek's case as low as 169. They'll do their best
to get back on track, but the outlook is not so good.
