<u>Robbie Alomar Jr.</u>
<br>One time when my mom was drunk she said she lied to me,<br>
I found out that my dad wasn't the guy who lived with me.<br>
In the summer of 92 when the Braves came to town,<br>
My mom went out and had a few and Robbie laid her down.

<font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><a href="#" name="robbie">Suddenly it all made sense to me, <br>
Why I looked hispanic when my dad was japanese. <br>
So I went away to tell Robbie I was his son, <br>
But he spit in my face and said you're not the only one.<br>

<br>To help you find your cane
<br>Get you back to the life of a drunken Ukrainian
</a></font></p><p>
<font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><a href="#" name="petro"><br>So take your time, think it out
<br>But there's some problems you're bound to meet
<br>Could be a broken heart, realising you sold out
<br>Or losing your cane in the middle of the street

<font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><a href="#" name="petro">(chorus)

<br>Didn't say you liked me back, you just said "ditto"
<br>Forgot about my birthday, that ain't so bad
<br>I was a little worried but I never got mad
<br>Because that was the first time I thought you'd show me the door
<br>Instead you waited till December 24 (Christmas hurts more)
