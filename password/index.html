<p><strong>Reset Your Ubuntu Password</strong></p>
<p>Reboot your computer, and then as soon as you see the GRUB Loading screen, make sure to hit the ESC key so that you can get to the menu.</p>
<p>If pressing ESC doesn't work, try holding the left SHIFT key after seeing the screen that says BIOS on it.  The timing for this can be tricky so you might need to restart and try again.</p>
